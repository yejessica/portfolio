## Personal Portfolio Website
Now live at [jjessicaye.com](https://jjessicaye.com/). This portfolio showcases my bio, experiences, projects, and skills. A bit barebones for now, but soon to be updated! Through this, I brushed up on my web development skills and learned Tailwind CSS (so convenient!). Future goals include adding integration with React.

### Technologies & Libraries Used
- HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS (A new library for me!)
- Components from Flowbite JS
